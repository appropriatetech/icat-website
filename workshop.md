## Mobile Technology Workshop

The goal of the workshop is to give participants an introduction to mobile tech
applications that enable new approaches to issues such as urban and community
planning, economics and markets, political participation, and personal and
environmental health. We wanted participants to leave with ideas of what's
possible and what some of the successes and pitfalls people have experienced are.

The workshop featured presenters from several projects and organizations
that are working on mobile empowerment tools.


### Schedule:

The workshop took place on Tuesday, 20 November 2012 at 2:00 PM at the St.
George conference center outside of Pretoria, South Africa.
