Background
==========

Climate change will impact the poorest countries and people the hardest. According to leading researchers, in Africa, climate change has already caused irreversible environmental damage. Curtailing harmful climate change and eradicating poverty necessitate sustainable, ecologically sound solutions. Presently, 1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate water access, and 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation. Eliminating poverty and improving the quality of life of the worlds’ poorest people, requires increased agriculture, industry and transport productivity made possible via improved water access and energy utilization. Most importantly, public health and human productivity require a technology practice that addresses peoples’ basic needs. Promoting appropriate technology requires implementing policies to safeguard Earth and empower the broadest population. These local, national and international policies will lead to more appropriate technology education, research and practice.

The 6th International Conference on Appropriate Technology (6th ICAT) will:

1. Promote knowledge creation, documentation, sharing and transfer to support
   appropriate technology education, research, development and implementation.
2. Focus on appropriate technology contributions to impact technology policy
   that will be environmentally sustainable and empower communities,
   particularly historically oppressed and disadvantaged populations
3. Provide a forum for networking on appropriate technology solutions for 21st
   century Africa through sustainable development mechanisms and models across
   Africa and the Global South

 The official language of the conference will be English.
