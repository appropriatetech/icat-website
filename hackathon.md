## Mobile Technology Hackathon

On Tuesday, 20 November we held a [workshop](workshop.html) on uses of mobile
computing and telephony devices in appropriate technology work. We heard
multiple examples of how this tech is being used to empower people in areas of
community planning, aggricultural economics, public transportation, natural
disaster response, and more. We followed up with a brief brainstorming period
where we thought of some ideas for new projects and applications that could be
developed in this area.

On Friday and Saturday, 23-24 November we held a hackathon to build on the
information presented and the ideas developed at the workshop.  The hackathon
will conclude with a round of judging during the week of 17 December.

### Proposals

We started the hackathon off with project pitches. Not all projects pitched were
worked on.

From the earlier workshop, several ideas were proposed.

*Security alerts service*

* Updated in real-time
* People can subscribe so that they know what areas to avoid

*Pest infestation*

* Create a rapid warning system to farmers

*Know your rights*

* People know when they've done something wrong, or been wronged, but not what their rights are in each situation
* Ability to access the laws from the mobile
* For example: You actually broke the law, 70 on a 40 – you can text, “I broke law here” the text would tell you the reprecussions and/or police procedures.

*Context-appropriate architecture guide*

* A catalog of building materials and methods that are best to use in a particular area
* Serves as a knowledge base/portal for those who are not native to the area in which they are building
* Also list the plot coverage/height minimums and other zoning regulations in an area



### Judging

Final judging will take place the week of 31 January, 2013. In order to
be elligible for a prize in this round:

* The source for your project must be publicly available on a service such as
  GitHub or BitBucket
* Your project must have a site explaining the purpose, usage, and any other
  relevant information about your project. Be sure to include why your project
  is an example of
  [appropriate technology](faq.html#what_is_appropriate_technology). The site
  can be as simple as one page of information. GitHub pages is a good platform
  for a project site, if that's where your code is hosted. For help on setting
  up a GH pages site, let us know at hackathon@icathack.org and we can help you
  out.
* Your project itself should also be accessible via the web (or by telephone for
  SMS interfaces) so that judges can access it. If, for some reason, this cannot
  be arranged, you may substitute a video demonstrating project usage.

Thanks to our sponsors, we will have around $1000 in awards to disburse. The
awards conferred during the second judging round will be as follows:

* **Most likely to succeed** – Given to the application which has the best
  deployment plan. The developers have identified partners who can help get the
  word out to users, and have ideas of how to encourage sustainable adoption by
  those users.

* **Best mobile interface(s)** – Given to the team that has the most well
  thought-out – and best looking – user interface or interfaces on mobile
  devices. This may entail elagant native GUIs, gracefully degrading web-based
  interfaces, or clear and intuitive SMS interfaces.

* **Most impactful** – Given to the team whose application tackles the most
  significant, most pressing issue.
