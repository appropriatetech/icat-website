## Mobile Technology Hackathon

On Tuesday, 20 November we held a [workshop](workshop.html) on uses of mobile
computing and telephony devices in appropriate technology work. We heard
multiple examples of how this tech is being used to empower people in areas of
community planning, aggricultural economics, public transportation, natural
disaster response, and more. We followed up with a brief brainstorming period
where we thought of some ideas for new projects and applications that could be
developed in this area.

During the hackathon, we will build on the information presented and the ideas
developed at the workshop. Technologists from the Pretoria area and from all
over the world will collaborate with scholars and practitioners from the
appropriate technology conference to start to build projects inspired by the
ideas of appropriate technology.

### Proposals

We started the hackathon off with project pitches. Not all projects pitched were
worked on.

From the earlier workshop, several ideas were proposed.

*Security alerts service*

* Updated in real-time
* People can subscribe so that they know what areas to avoid

*Pest infestation*

* Create a rapid warning system to farmers

*Know your rights*

* People know when they've done something wrong, or been wronged, but not what their rights are in each situation
* Ability to access the laws from the mobile
* For example: You actually broke the law, 70 on a 40 – you can text, “I broke law here” the text would tell you the reprecussions and/or police procedures.

*Context-appropriate architecture guide*

* A catalog of building materials and methods that are best to use in a particular area
* Serves as a knowledge base/portal for those who are not native to the area in which they are building
* Also list the plot coverage/height minimums and other zoning regulations in an area



### Judging

Final judging will take place the week of 17 December. In order to
be elligible for a prize in this round:

* The source for your project must be publicly available on a service such as
  GitHub or BitBucket
* Your project must have a (simple) site explaining the purpose, usage, and any
  other relevant information.
* Your project itself should also be accessible via the web or by telephone so
  that judges can access it. If, for some reason, this cannot be arranged, you
  may substitute a video demonstrating project usage.

The awards conferred during the second judging round will be as follows:

* **Most improved** – Given to the team whose application has seen the most 
  improvement between the first round of judging and the second.

* **Most likely to succeed** – Given to the application which has the best 
  deployment plan. The developers have identified partners who can help get the
  word out to users, and have ideas of how to encourage sustainable adoption by
  those users.

* **Best mobile interface(s)** – Given to the team that has the most well 
  thought-out – and best looking – user interface or interfaces on mobile 
  devices. This may entail elagant native GUIs, gracefully degrading web-based
  interfaces, or clear and intuitive SMS interfaces.

* **Most impactful** – Given to the team whose application tackles the most 
  significant, most pressing issue.
