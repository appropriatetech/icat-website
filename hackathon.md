## Mobile Technology Hackathon

The Mobile Technology workshop at the International Conference on Appropriate Technology 
During the hackathon, we will build on the information presented and the ideas
developed at the [workshop](workshop.html). Technologists from the Pretoria area

from the appropriate technology conference to start to build projects inspired
by the ideas of appropriate technology.

### Proposals

We'll start the day off with project pitches. If there is a problem that you
think should be addressed, or a solution that you'd like to see implemented,
come and pitch it to the hackathon participants. Not all projects pitched will
be worked on, but projects with a champion are more likely to move forward.



### Judging

Judging will occur in two rounds. The first round, on 24 November, will rank
projects according to quality of idea, and execution, with particular attention
paid to the use of mobile interfaces.

The second round of judging will take place the week of 17 December. In order to
be elligible for a prize in this round, the source for your project must be publicly 
available on a service such as GitHub or BitBucket, and your project must have a
(simple) site explaining the purpose and usage. Your project itself should also be
accessible via the web or by telephone. If, for some reason, this cannot be arranged,
you may substitute a video demonstrating project usage.  Contact us if this will be 
the case.

The awards conferred during the second judging round will be as follows:

**Most improved**

Given to the team whose application has seen the most improvement between the
first round of judging and the second.

**Most likely to succeed**

Given to the application which has the best deployment plan. The developers have
identified partners who can help get the word out to users, and have ideas of
how to encourage sustainable adoption by those users.

**Best mobile interface(s)**

Given to the team that has the most well thought-out -- and best looking -- user
interface or interfaces on mobile devices. This may entail elagant native GUIs,
gracefully degrading web-based interfaces, or clear and intuitive SMS interfaces.

**Most impactful**

Given to the team whose application tackles the most significant, most pressing
issue.

We recommend that all teams pursue all awards.
