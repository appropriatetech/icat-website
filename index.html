<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Climate change will impact the poorest countries and people the hardest. According to leading researchers, in Africa, climate change has already caused irreversible environmental damage. Curtailing harmful climate change and eradicating poverty necessitate sustainable, ecologically sound solutions. Presently, 1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate water access, and 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation. Eliminating poverty and improving the quality of life of the worlds’ poorest people, requires increased agriculture, industry and transport productivity made possible via improved water access and energy utilization. Most importantly, public health and human productivity require a technology practice that addresses peoples’ basic needs. Promoting appropriate technology requires implementing policies to safeguard Earth and empower the broadest population. These local, national and international policies will lead to more appropriate technology education, research and practice.

<p>The 6th International Conference on Appropriate Technology (6th ICAT) will:

<ol>
  <li>Promote knowledge creation, documentation, sharing and transfer to support appropriate technology education, research, development and implementation.
  <li>Focus on appropriate technology contributions to impact technology policy that will be environmentally sustainable and empower communities, particularly historically oppressed and disadvantaged populations
  <li>Provide a forum for networking on appropriate technology solutions for 21st century Africa through sustainable development mechanisms and models across Africa and the Global South
</ol>

<p>The official language of the conference will be English.

<h2>Workshops</h2>

<h3>3D Printing Workshop - <i>DATES TBD</i></h3>

<img class="workshop-image" alt="3D Printer" src="images/RepRap.jpg">
<p>
  Open-source 3-D printers permit rapid prototyping of models developed in software - they produce the physical part represented by the two dimensional rendition on a designer's computer screen. Parts are produced by placing one thin layer of plastic upon another, using heat to melt and fuse the plastic to the previous layer, until the full part is produced. Plastic is supplied as a filament, similar to fishing line, which is heated and pushed through a small nozzle. The nozzle moves in a horizontal plane, guided by a computer to produce the cross section of the part at that height. This process is repeated over and again until the entire part is produced.
<p>
  Many useful open-source designs of parts to print are already available for people to download. the printer is itself open-source and freely available to anyone wishing to use or modify it.

<p>
  Attendees of the two day 3-D printer workshop will;
<ul>
  <li>build a RepRap 3-D printer from kits,
  <li>learn to operate the printer,
  <li>learn how to download and prepare models for printing, and
  <li>Will be introduced to some of the freely available open-source software available to create models of parts to print.
</ul>

<p>Attendees are expected to possess basic assembly experience (such as building models) and must have laptop computers that can have software installed on them at the workshop. Simple tools (pliers, wire cutters, etc.) will also be required.

<h3>Appropriate Tech Hackathon</h3>

<img class="workshop-image" alt="Participants from the 2012 hackathon" src="images/hackathon-participants.png">
<p>
  We will build on the information presented and the ideas developed at the workshop. Technologists from the Pretoria area and from all over the world will collaborate with scholars and practitioners from the appropriate technology conference to start to build projects inspired by the ideas of appropriate technology.
